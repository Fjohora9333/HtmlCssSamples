        <h2>Flags in Canada</h2>
        <p>A new Canadian flag was raised for the first time
        in 1965. The red-white-red pattern comes from
        the flag of the Royal Military College, Kingston,
        founded in 1876. Red and white had been colours
        of France and England since the Middle Ages and
        the national colours of Canada since 1921. The
        Union Jack is our official Royal Flag. The Canadian
        Red Ensign served as the Canadian flag for about
        100 years. The provinces and territories also have
        flags that embody their distinct traditions.</p>

        <h2>The maple leaf</h2>
        <p>The maple leaf is Canada’s best-known symbol.
        Maple leaves were adopted as a symbol by
        French Canadians in the 1700s, have appeared
        on Canadian uniforms and insignia since the
        1850s, and are carved into the headstones of our
        fallen soldiers buried overseas and in Canada. </p>

        <h2>The fleur-de-lys</h2>
        <p>It is said that the lily flower (“fleur-de-lys”) was
        adopted by the French king in the year 496. It
        became the symbol of French royalty for more than
        1,000 years, including the colony of New France.
        Revived at Confederation, the fleur-de-lys was
        included in the Canadian Red Ensign. In 1948
        Quebec adopted its own flag, based on the Cross
        and the fleur-de-lys.</p>
