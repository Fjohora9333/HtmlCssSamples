        <h2>THE FIRST EUROPEANS</h2>
        <p>The Vikings from Iceland who colonized
        Greenland 1,000 years ago also reached Labrador
        and the island of Newfoundland. The remains
        of their settlement, l’Anse aux Meadows, are a
        World Heritage site.
        European exploration began in earnest in 1497
        with the expedition of John Cabot, who was the
        first to draw a map of Canada’s East Coast.</p>
        
        <h2>EXPlORING A RIVER, NAMING CANADA</h2>
        <p>Between 1534 and 1542, Jacques Cartier made
        three voyages across the Atlantic, claiming the
        land for King Francis I of France. Cartier heard
        two captured guides speak the Iroquoian word
        kanata, meaning “village.” By the 1550s, the
        name of Canada began appearing on maps.</p>
        
        <h2>ROYAl NEW FRANCE</h2>
        <p>In 1604, the first European settlement north   of Florida was established by French explorers
            Pierre de Monts and Samuel de Champlain, first
            on St. Croix Island (in present-day Maine), then at
            Port-Royal, in Acadia (present-day Nova Scotia).
            In 1608 Champlain built a fortress at what is now
            Québec City. The colonists struggled against a
            harsh climate. Champlain allied the colony with
            the Algonquin, Montagnais and Huron, historic
            enemies of the Iroquois, a confederation of five
            (later six) First Nations who battled with the
            French settlements for a century. The French and
            the Iroquois made peace in 1701. </p>
               <p>The French and Aboriginal people collaborated
            in the vast fur-trade economy, driven by the
            demand for beaver pelts in Europe. Outstanding
            leaders like Jean Talon, Bishop Laval, and Count
            Frontenac built a French Empire in North America
            that reached from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of
            Mexico.</p>
            
            <h2>STRUGGlE FOR A CONTINENT</h2>
            <p>In 1670, King Charles II of England granted the Hudson’s Bay Company exclusive trading rights over the watershed draining into Hudson Bay. For the next 100 years the Company competed with Montreal-based traders. The skilled and courageous men who travelled by canoe were called voyageurs and coureurs des bois, and formed strong alliances with First Nations. </p>
