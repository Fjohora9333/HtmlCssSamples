	New York Times columnist and author, Andrew Ross Sorkin, has been described as the most famous financial journalist of his generation. A leading voice on Wall Street and corporate America, his New York Times bestseller, Too Big to Fail, was the first true, behind-the-scenes, moment-by-moment account of how that financial crisis developed into a global tsunami.

	<p>
	The Economist, The Financial Times, and Business Week all named Too Big To Fail one of the best books of the year. The book was published by Viking October 20, 2009. The book was adapted as a movie by HBO Films and premiered on HBO on May 23, 2011. The film was directed by Curtis Hanson, and the screenplay was written by Peter Gould.
